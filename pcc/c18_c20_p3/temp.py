"""
We’ll write a web app called Learning Log 
that allows users to log the topics they’re interested in 
and to make journal entries as they learn about each topic. 

The Learning Log home page will describe the site 
and invite users to either register or log in. 

Once logged in, a user can create new topics, 
add new entries, and read and edit existing entries.
