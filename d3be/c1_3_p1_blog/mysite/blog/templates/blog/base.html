{% load static %}

<!--
    {.% load static %.} 
    tells Django to load the static template tags that are provided by the django.contrib.staticfiles application, 
    which is contained in the INSTALLED_APPS setting. 
    After loading them, you are able to use the {.% static %.} template tag throughout this template. 
    With this template tag, you can include the static files, such as the blog.css file, 
    which you will find in the code of this example under the static/ directory of the blog application
